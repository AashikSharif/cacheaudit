Salsa20:
********
-Code analyzes encryption of 512 byte block
-Initialization (e.g. IV and Key) is omitted, modulo initialization of the block counter (x->init[8]) to 0.



Results:
********
Number of valid cache configurations : 0x1, that is 0.000000 bits.
Analysis took 11 seconds.

This (partially) confirms a claim by Bernstein about non-timing leakage of Salsa20.

Confirmed with small caches (256b) and FIFO and PLRU strategies

Remarks: 
******** 
Analysis does not work with uninitialized counters,
because of two reasons: 
- "test" is applied to the counter and does not yet work for intervals 
- "lea" is used to increment the counter, and fails on TOP, because CacheCow anticipated use of lea on addresses. 
Both issues are fixed by initializing the counter.
- function calls seem to work!
