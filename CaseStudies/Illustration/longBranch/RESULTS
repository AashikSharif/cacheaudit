NOTE: In this analysis it doesn't matter the architecture chosen. There is only one possible data cache state.


Values chosen for cache size were the default:
Cache size 16384, array size 32.


Analysis of longBranch:
***********************

Nonrelation analysis:
Number of valid cache configurations : 0x20000, that is 17.000000 bits.

Relational analysis:
Valid cache configurations computed with relational Information : 0x2, that is 1.000000 bits.



Analysis of longerBranch:
*************************

Nonrelation analysis:
Number of valid cache configurations : 0x0, that is 70.000000 bits. (0x0: Overflow in configurations counter?? Also maximun number of leaked bits is supposed to be 32)

Relational analysis:
Valid cache configurations computed with relational Information : 0x2, that is 1.000000 bits.
Analysis took 170 seconds.
