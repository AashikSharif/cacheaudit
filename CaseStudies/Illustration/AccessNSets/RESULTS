Depending on some (unpredictable) conditional, either one block for each cache set gets accessed or none.
One certain block will get accessed in any case. That's why the uncertainty is numberofsets/2

* Cache: size 4096 bytes, lines 32b, assoc 4.
* numberofsets 10
Number of valid cache configurations : 0x400, that is 10.000000 bits.
Valid cache configurations computed with relational Information : 0x2,that is 1.000000 bits.

* numberofsets 16
Number of valid cache configurations : 0x10000, that is 16.000000 bits.
Valid cache configurations computed with relational Information : 0x2,that is 1.000000 bits.

* numberofsets 17
Number of valid cache configurations : 0x20000, that is 17.000000 bits.
Valid cache configurations computed with relational Information : 0x2,that is 1.000000 bits.
