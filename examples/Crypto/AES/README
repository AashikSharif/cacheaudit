AES implementation taken from the PolarSSL library

The PolarSSL1.3.7 folder contains the currently analyzed implementations.
Pre-compiled executables are included.
Can be recompiled using the Makefile. If you do so,
when using cacheaudit, make sure to specify the correct start address 
(e.g. do nm target | grep "T main").

In the archive folder old implementations of AES are stored,
which are superseeded by the contents of PolarSSL1.3.7/.
