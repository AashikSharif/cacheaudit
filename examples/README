Example Portfolio:
- AES implementation taken from PolarSSL 1.3.7 (https://polarssl.org/)
- Software finalists of the eSTREAM stream cipher competition (http://www.ecrypt.eu.org/stream/)
- Sorting algorithms (http://www.codebeach.com/2008/09/sorting-algorithms-in-c.html)

Pre-compiled executables and corresponding configuration files are included. They can be recompiled using the Makefile. If you do so, when using cacheaudit, make sure to specify the correct start address (e.g. do nm target | grep "T main").
