Example Portfolio:
------------------

- AES implementation from PolarSSL 1.3.7 (https://polarssl.org/)
- Software finalists of the eSTREAM stream cipher competition (http://www.ecrypt.eu.org/stream/)
- Sorting algorithms (http://www.codebeach.com/2008/09/sorting-algorithms-in-c.html)




Compiling the executables: 
-------------------------- 

- The distribution contains pre-compiled (Linux 32-bit) executables
  and corresponding configuration files that specify the entry point
  for the x86 parser (here: the address of main()).

- The distribution also contains the sources of all examples, together
  with Makefiles for recompilation. However, this has been tested only
  on a Linux 3.13.0-34 with GCC 4.8.2 on Ubuntu 14.04; compilation on
  any other system need not work because the compiler may produce
  commands that are currently not supported by CacheAudit's x86
  parser. Moreover, it requires the user to determine the parser entry
  point for the resulting executable (e.g. do nm target | grep "T
  main").
