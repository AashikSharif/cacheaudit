Example Portfolio:
- AES implementation taken from PolarSSL 1.3.7 (https://polarssl.org/)
- Software finalists of the eSTREAM stream cipher competition (http://www.ecrypt.eu.org/stream/)
- Sorting algorithms (http://www.codebeach.com/2008/09/sorting-algorithms-in-c.html)

Pre-compiled executables and corresponding configuration files are included. Executables can be recompiled using the given Makefiles, however this has been tested only on a Linux 3.13.0-34 with GCC 4.8.2 on Ubuntu 14.04; compilation on any other system may not work. If you do so, when using cacheaudit, make sure to specify the correct start address (e.g. do nm target | grep "T main").
